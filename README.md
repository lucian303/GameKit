Game Kit - GKIT Version Infinity Final Forever
Copyright 1995-2012 Lucian Hontau

Nostalgia Release

This is what I did with my teenage years amongst many other things ...
I used this to build games and demos.

This is a shareware release of the Game Kit
Version 0.5 BETA. It is a game library that runs
under Watcom C/C++ 9.5 or above. It has many
features including Virtual 18-bit color and
SFX. 

Please, don't judge too quickly. I was young. :)

Enjoy,
Lucian Hontau
